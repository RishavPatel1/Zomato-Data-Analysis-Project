# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Project
In the Zomato Data Analysis project, I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to create count plots, line plots, histograms, box plots, and a heatmap for visualizing restaurant types, ratings, and ordering preferences. These visualizations helped in understanding data distribution and trends effectively.
